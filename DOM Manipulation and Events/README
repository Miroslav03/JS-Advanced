1. List of Items
Write a function that reads the text inside an input field and appends the specified text to a list inside an HTML
page.


2. Delete from Table
Write a program that takes an email from an input field and deletes the matching row from a table.
 If entry is found, the textContent in the element with id="result" must be set to "Deleted."
 Otherwise, an error should be displayed in a <div> with id="result". The error should be "Not
found."

Input/Output
There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document

3. Add / Delete
Extend the previous problem to display a [Delete] link after each list item. Clicking it should delete the item with
no confirmation. You have to add href="#" to the link element.

4. Mouse Gradient
Write a program that detects and displays how far along a gradient the user has moved their mouse. The result
should be rounded down and displayed as a percentage inside the <div> with id "result".
Submit only the attachGradientEvents() function in Judge.
Input/Output
There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

5. Highlight Active
Write a function that highlights the currently active section of a document. There will be multiple divs with input
fields inside them. Set the class of the div that contains the currently focused input field to "focused". When
the focus is lost (blurred), remove the class from the element.
Submit only the focused() function in Judge.
Input/Output
There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

6. Dynamic Validation
Write a function that dynamically validates an email input field when it is changed. If the input is invalid, apply
the class "error". Do not validate on every keystroke, as it is annoying for the user, consider only change events.
A valid email is considered to be in the format: <name>@<domain>.<extension>
Only lowercase Latin characters are allowed for any of the parts of the email. If the input is valid, clear the style.
Submit only the validate() function in Judge.
Input/Output
There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.

7. Shopping Cart
You will be given some products that you should be able to add to your cart. Each product will have a name,
picture, and price.
When the "Add" button is clicked, append the current product to the textarea in the following format: "Added
{name} for {money} to the cart.\n". The price must be fixed to the second digit.
When the button "Checkout" is clicked, calculate the total money that you need to pay for the products that are
currently in your cart. Append the result to the textarea in the following format:
"You bought {list} for {totalPrice}."
The list should contain only the unique products, separated by ", ". The total price should be rounded to the
second decimal point.
Also, after clicking over "Checkout" and every from above is done you should disable all buttons. (You can't add
products or checkout again if once the checkout button is clicked).
