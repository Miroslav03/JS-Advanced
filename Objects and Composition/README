1.	City Record
You will receive a city’s name (string), population (number), and treasury (number) as arguments, which you will need to set as properties of an object and return it.

2.	Town Population
You have been tasked to create a registry for different towns and their population.
Input
The input comes as array of strings. Each element will contain data for a town and its population in the following format: "{townName} <-> {townPopulation}"
If you receive the same town twice, you should add the given population to the current one.

3.	City Taxes
This task is an extension of Problem 1, you may use your solution from that task as a base.
You will receive a city’s name (string), population (number), and treasury (number) as arguments, which you will need to set as properties of an object and return it. In addition to the input parameters, the object must have a property taxRate with an initial value of 10, and three methods for managing the city:
•	collectTaxes() - Increase treasury by  population * taxRate
•	applyGrowth(percentage) - Increase population by given percentage
•	applyRecession(percentage) - Decrease treasury by given percentage
Round down the values after each calculation.
Input
Your solution will receive three valid parameters. The methods that expect parameters will be tested with valid input.
Output
Return an object as described above. The methods of the object modify the object and don’t return anything.

4.	Object Factory
Create a function that can compose objects by copying functions from a given library of functions. You will receive two parameters – a library of functions as an associative array (object) and an array of orders, represented as objects. You must return a new array – the fulfilled orders.
The first parameter will be an object where each property is a function. You will use this library of functions to compose new objects.
The second parameter is an array of orders. Each order is an object with the following shape:
{
  template: [Object],
  parts: string[]
}
A template is an object that must be copied. The parts array contains the names of required functions as strings.
You must create and return a new array, by fulfilling all orders from the orders array. To fulfill an order, create a copy of the object’s template and then add to it all functions, listed in the parts array of the order, by taking them from the function library (the first parameter to your solution).
Input
You will receive two parameters:
•	library – an object
•	orders – an array of objects
Output
Your solution must return an array of objects.

5.	Assembly Line
Create a function that returns a library of decorator functions. They can be used to compose different functionality in a car object that they receive as an argument.
Your solution must return an object, containing three decorator functions:
hasClima – compose air conditioning controls into the passed-in object. This function takes an object as a parameter and adds to it the following properties:
•	temp – number with default value 21;
•	tempSettings – number with default value 21;
•	adjustTemp – function which takes no arguments. If temp is less than tempSettings, this function adds 1 to temp. If temp is more than tempSettings, it decreases temp by 1. If temp and tempSettings are equal, the function does nothing.
hasAudio – compose audio player functionality into the passed-in object. This function takes an object as a parameter and adds to it the following properties:
•	currentTrack – object with properties name (string) and artist (string). The default value is null;
•	nowPlaying – function, which prints on the console the text: 
  `Now playing '${currentTrack.name}' by ${currentTrack.artist}` , where name and artist are properties of the currentTrack object. If currentTrack is null, this function does nothing.
hasParktronic – compose parking aid functionality into the passed in object. This function takes an object as a parameter and adds to it the following properties:
•	checkDistance – function, which takes a single argument distance (number) and prints a message on the console, depending on its value:
distance < 0.1 – "Beep! Beep! Beep!"
0.1 <= distance < 0.25 – "Beep! Beep!"
0.25 <= distance < 0.5 – "Beep!"
In any other case, print an empty string.
Input
Your solution will receive no arguments. All the methods in the returned library must take an object as an argument. Any methods that you compose into this object must meet the input requirements listed in the description above.
Output
Your solution must return an object containing the three decorators described above.

6.	From JSON to HTML Table
You’re tasked with creating an HTML table of students and their scores. You will receive a single string representing an array of objects, the table’s headings should be equal to the object’s keys, while each object’s values should be a new entry in the table. Any text values in an object should be escaped, to avoid introducing dangerous code into the HTML. 
Input
The input comes with a single string argument (the array of objects).
Output
The output should be printed on the console – for each entry row in the input print the object representing it.
Note:
Objects’ keys will always be the same. Check more information for the HTML Entity here.
HTML
You are provided with an HTML file to test your table in the browser.
